# VGDC-Castlevania
Quarter-long learning-based project made during Fall 2016. 

2D action platformer, just like the original _Castlevania_.

Your way of attacking is the whip. Simply click at an enemy that's within your range, and it will take damage.
Using raycasting, the whip can be used within 360 degrees of the player (we don't actually have separate sprites/animations for this, due to time constraints).
